## About Me

I'm Catherine, a junior fullstack developer based in London.

I started my tech journey in 2021 when I became a QA Analyst in America for a mobile shopping application. I moved to the UK in December 2021 and started Le Wagon, a London based coding bootcamp in January of 2022. I learned the basics of fullstack web development using JavaScript, Ruby, PostgreSQL, Figma, as well as strategic thinking when it comes to debugging and problem solving. Within the last three weeks, my team created two applications: VenuLet ( an AirBnb clone) and BandMates (mobile app to bring musicians together). Both apps can be viewed within my repos. 

After I completed 9 weeks at Le Wagon, I became a Junior Full-Stack Web Developer with Venntro Media Group in April 2021. At Venntro, I was able to strengthen my knowledge of Ruby and learn about other languages such as Cold Fusion and MySQL. I work closely with our senior developers as I continue to learn more about programming overall as well as a few solo tasks: fixing bugs within admin, building ReCAPTCHAs on our contact forms, assisting with UI designs, etc.

When I'm not working, I love working on my digital art through Adobe products and Procreate. I enjoy being outside and exploring the many parts of London I have yet to visit. I have two cats: Mjoll and June who love to play and sleep.

## Skills

- Quick learner: I am able to pick up new languages and technologies quickly. I enjoy learning and always go the extra mile to ensure what I pick up is accurate and efficient.
- Adobe (Illustrator, InDesign, PhotoShop): I have been using Adobe products since 2010. I first started with PhotoShop CS4 to play around with images to see what I could create. I was introduced to InDesign back in school when working on my high school's literary magazine. 
- Sketch: I have been working with Sketch within the past 18 months to better my knowledge in design and mockups.
